Before going to a local Bitcoin meetup, message the group that you will be swapping sats card for a speciifc amount, say 1 million satoshi
once you arrive at the meetup, locate counter parties for the swap and begin exchanging satscards.
both parties should confirm their own cards first using nunchuck on their phones. then show the balance to the other party.
then swap cards, and check the balances again with nunchuck wallet on each others phones to confirm.
sweeping the funds is optional.
repeat this with as many particiapting people as possible.
but be sure to remmeber your origional cards details (the receving address for example) so you don't recieve it back by mistake from someone else.
