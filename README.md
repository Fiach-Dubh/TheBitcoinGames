Game One: The Open Dime Challenge

Game Master Instructions:

>Setup an opendime for each participant in the race. 

>Deposit 10000 SATS to each still sealed opendime. 

>(For a more difficult challange, deposit only 1 satoshi to each opendime).

>Record each recieving address of each opendime along with the corresponding participants name into a list and create a leader board.

>This leaderboard will show when the funds have been swept from one of the opendime addresses.

>disperse opendime to each participant. (it may be more fun if they are not aware of the dynamics of this game beforehand, but more chaotic.)

>inform them of the objective of the game.

>"The goal of this game is to sweep the funds from your opendime as fast as possible to (insert a bitcoin address)"

>(it would be fun if this were the genesis block address, as this would burn the funds and pay homeage to satoshi: 1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa)"

>The first one to sweep the funds, wins the prize and eternal glory.

>Participants may be requird to pay a fee to participate, and this pool of funds could be dispersed to the winner/games master.

>optional materials that could be provided, each of these can be strategically placed for running/finding purposes:

>push pins to unseal the opendime 

>laptops and or OTG phone adaptors for usb interface with the opendime

>wifi hotspot to broadcast the transaction

>the password to this hotspot could be another small challenge to find, for example, a bitcoin riddle challenge for the password

>the sending address may be written down and hidden somewhere or buried

>The broadcast or the confirmation of a transaction may be the finish line.

>If two or more winning opendimes are swept at the same time and confirmed in the same block, then it's a tie and the winners share the prize.

>Prizes could include Bitcoin, Bitcoin hardware, swag, etc.

>this game can be used as a first/second/third draft game for future tournament games. First top 10 to place could move on to the next tournamnent round for example.

>the game master(s) would need to act as referees and auditors to monitor the participants in case of fowl play.

>timing each participant and creating a historical leader board for this game would be ideal, but would require standardizing each element. 

>Recording the participants may be very entertaining and ensure good faith of each.
