Create a seed - wallet
Deposit say 1 million sats to the wallet (can vary depending on buy ins from participants etc)
Give each participant a copy of the seed words and a laptop (with either wallet software already installed or none to make it harder)
Alternativly, and preferrably they bring their own.
have each particpant race to recover the wallet and spend to their own wallet.
Each participant can use RBF to out bid the others transaction.
this requires each participant having knowledge of the other participants fee bids, or guessing what the max bid would be for the group and out bidding that bid
First participant transaction to be confirmed is the obvious winner.
